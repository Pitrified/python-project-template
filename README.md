## TODOs

### Write a script to initialize the project

- [ ] Copy the `project_name` folder to the new project name.
- [ ] Replace all instances of `project_name` with the new project name.
      With proper capitalization.
- [ ] Remove dependencies from the `pyproject.toml` file.
- [ ] Automagically generate the optional dependencies list,
      by parsing the `pyproject.toml` file.
      I don't like this already. Just put the dependencies in the meta README.
